          <p>Marjorie was born on January 6, 1942, in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, and raised on a dairy farm where she helped care for Jersey cows. One special cow, a twin gifted to her by her father, went on to win several ribbons and cash prizes. Though money at home was tight, she used those winnings to buy nice clothes for school. A highlight of her childhood was earning a trip to the International Dairy Show in Chicago, where she saw her first movie, <em>Susan Slept Here</em>.</p>

          <p>Raised in the Church of Christ, Marjorie wasn’t allowed to dance—so when prom came around, she told her dad it was just a party. A small fib, but it worked—he let her go. Later, while visiting her sister at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, she met her first husband, dropped out of high school, and moved to Nebraska. That marriage brought three children: Jon, Joel, and Julie.</p>

          <p>Over the years, Marjorie held a variety of jobs, including factory work, working with troubled youth, and eventually spent 25 years as a school cook before retiring. Alongside raising her family, she returned to school, earned her GED, and even received a college scholarship. In 1983, she married Duane Johnson, and they shared a loving marriage for 40 years. Together they raised and showed miniature horses, winning prizes at shows across the country.</p>

          <p>After Duane’s passing in 2023, Marjorie returned to Tennessee to be closer to family. She now enjoys time with her cat Cali, gardening, and watching Netflix. She's most proud of the children and grandchildren she helped raise—and the honest, loving life she’s built.</p>
